Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to creating an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to showcase strong analytical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights.
The workflow includes:

Data loading & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

SQL operations on PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Building a visual dashboard in Power BI

Creating a final presentation using Gamma

Dataset

The dataset is included in the repository (or you can add your own).

It contains structured data suitable for analytics, including numeric, categorical, and date columns.

Data source: (Add link or description if applicable)

Tools & Technologies Used

Python → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA

SQL → PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server for querying

Power BI → Dashboard & visualization

Gamma → Project presentation

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code → Development environment

Git & GitHub → Version control

Project Steps
1. Load Dataset in Python

Imported CSV/Excel data

Checked data types, size, and overall structure

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Missing value analysis

Correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, trend analysis

3. Data Cleaning

Handling null values

Fixing data types

Outlier treatment

Feature formatting (dates, categories, etc.)

4. SQL Analysis

Performed SQL queries on a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server).
Examples include:

Filtering & grouping

Joins across tables

Aggregations

Window functions

5. Power BI Dashboard

Connected cleaned dataset

Built interactive visuals

Added filters, KPIs, and insights

Designed a clean, business-ready dashboard

6. Presentation using Gamma

Summarized key findings

Highlighted insights and trends

Included screenshots of dashboards and SQL results
